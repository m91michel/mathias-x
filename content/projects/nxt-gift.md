[Nxt-Gift](https://nxt-gift.netlify.com/){:target="_blank"} is a side project where I am trying to solve the problem of getting gift inspiration. Currently, the in google listed sites offer a huge list of cheap products and ideas for DIY presents are missing on these sites. Pinterest is a nice option for inspiration, but there is still a lot of other stuff where you have to scroll through. I am trying to solve this problem with Nxt-Gift which provides a curated list of gift ideas. Each product will have a link to the site where you either get more information about an idea or where you can buy it.
