Yeah! Welcome to my first blog post! After a long time of thinking whether I should start my own blog and what topic should I address, I started and set up my new site [mathias.rocks].

The goal of this site is to list current side projects and to start writing down my thoughts. The topics which I want to address are technical problems or ideas regarding iOS or web development. Furthermore, I want to improve my English writing skills, therefore, I decided to write about technical topics in English.

I hope you enjoy reading. :)
